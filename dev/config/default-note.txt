# Welcome to IrisNotes Development

This is the default note for local development mode.

## Development Features

- Local configuration directory: `./dev/config/`
- Local SQLite database: `./dev/config/notes.db`
- Local notes directory: `./dev/config/notes/`
- Sample data included for testing

## Getting Started

1. Edit this note to test the editor
2. Create new notes using the + button
3. Test different storage backends in settings
4. Try switching between rich and source modes

This setup keeps your development environment isolated from production data.
